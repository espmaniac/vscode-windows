      <h1>vscode-windows</h1>
      <p><strong>vscode-windows</strong> is a VSCode extension that lets you open multiple <strong>floating Monaco editors</strong> in a single panel. Each editor window is draggable, resizable, and supports zooming and panning across the workspace.</p>
      <blockquote>
        ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> These are <strong>Monaco editors embedded in a webview</strong>, not native VSCode editors. You <strong>cannot apply your VSCode theme</strong> fully, and some editor features/settings may not work. The extension only approximates the VSCode look.

## Features

- Multiple floating editor windows in one panel  
- Draggable and resizable windows  
- Pan and zoom workspace with mouse or keyboard (`Alt + +`, `-`, `0`)  
- Automatic language detection based on file extension  
- Real-time synchronization with VSCode documents  
- Undo/redo within each Monaco editor  

## How it Works

- The extension creates a **webview panel** containing Monaco editors.  
- Each editor is **independent** but updates are sent to the VSCode workspace in real-time.  
- Floating editors are **confined to the webview** and cannot become native VSCode tabs.  

## Limitations

- You **cannot fully apply VSCode themes or color customizations**; the extension approximates colors using CSS variables.  
- Editors do not support all VSCode extensions or editor settings.  
- Floating editors exist only inside the webview panel.  

## Commands

- `Open Windows`: Opens the floating Monaco window panel for the active editor.  

## Usage

1. Install the extension.  
2. Open a file in VSCode.  
3. Run the command **`Open Windows`** from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P).  
4. Drag, resize, and edit multiple floating Monaco windows simultaneously.
